This problem was asked by Stitch Fix.
Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of integers constructed with the following formula:
â€¢	The first row consists of the number 1.
â€¢	For each subsequent row, each element is the sum of the numbers directly above it, on either side.
For example, here are the first few rows:
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
Given an input k, return the kth row of Pascal's triangle.
Bonus: Can you do this using only O(k) space?
